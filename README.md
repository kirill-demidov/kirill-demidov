# 👋 Hi! I'm Kirill Demidov

## 🚀 Data Enthusiast & Engineer

I'm passionate about working with data across industries — from gaming and urban analytics to automation tools and bots.
I enjoy turning raw data into clear insights, building reliable pipelines, and creating tools people actually use.

Currently based in Tel Aviv, Israel, working at OneUp Games — where I dive into ETL, Big Data, and automation every day.
For me, data engineering isn't just about moving numbers around — it's about solving real problems in smarter, faster ways.
